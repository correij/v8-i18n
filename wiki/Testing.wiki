== Dependencies necessary for running the tests ==

  # GYP build system
  # ICU library
  # V8 library

You should checkout Chrome and get all of the dependencies.

=== Getting GYP ===

  # Go to the root of v8-i18n checkout.
  # Run 'svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp' command.

In case you are getting *ar* errors during linking, you may have hit a problem with
symlinks and ar. Please replace all 'crsT' with 'crs' in gyp generator (removes non-essential support for thin archives):

*build/gyp/pylib/gyp/generator/make.py*:
{{{
-    arflags_target = 'crsT'
+    arflags_target = 'crs'
}}}

=== Getting Chrome ===

Follow Chromium instructions at [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code] but name your checkout folder *chrome* for easier unit testing.

=== Generate make files ===

  * python build/build_gyp.py

You may have to change paths to v8 and icu in the script to point to your checkout location.

=== Building ===

Linux:  *make -j30 test-runner*

=== Running tests ===

Take a look at README.txt in each of the tests/ subfolders, e.g. tests/test262/README.txt.

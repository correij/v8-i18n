== Dependencies necessary for running the tests ==

  # GYP build system
  # ICU library
  # V8 library

If you are running tests under Chromium you have all them available already.

=== Getting GYP ===

  # Go to the root of v8-i18n checkout.
  # Run 'svn co http://gyp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk build/gyp' command.

In case you are getting *ar* errors during linking, you may have hit a problem with
symlinks and ar. Please patch gyp generator like so (removes non-essential support for thin archives):

*gyp/pylib/generator/make.py*:
{{{
-    arflags_target = 'crsT'
+    arflags_target = 'crs'
}}}

=== Getting ICU ===

  * svn checkout http://src.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/icu46 icu


=== Getting V8 ===

  * svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8


=== Generate make files ===

  * python build/build_gyp.py

You may have to change paths to v8 and icu in the script to point to your checkout location.

=== Building ===

Linux:  *make -j30 test-runner*

=== Running tests ===

Take a look at README.txt in each of the tests/ subfolders, e.g. tests/test262/README.txt.
